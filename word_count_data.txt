Hadoop Streaming is a feature that comes with Hadoop and allows users or
developers to use various different languages for writing MapReduce
programs like Python, C++, Ruby, etc. It supports all the languages that can
read from standard input and write to standard output. We will be
implementing Python with Hadoop Streaming and will observe how it
works. We will implement the word count problem in python to understand
Hadoop Streaming. We will be creating mapper.py and reducer.py to
perform map and reduce tasks.
